# Picture Viewer

A simple means of viewing an album of pictures.

## Desired Future Features

* Improved UI; currently a little clunky and not fully clear on where you are in the image list
* Add for additional input from images, perhaps a title text and maybe a description
* An all picture view (scrollable if enough images are present)
* Upload image pack
* Maybe an electron wrapper for desktop execution
* A build process (none exists now, just a testing env)
* Some test toggles of features
